          <div class="intro-essay">
            <p>When I first joined a volunteer program supporting people with autism, my task seemed simple: play games, read picture books, keep company. One afternoon, I played a strategy board game with a young man who worked at a autistism-friendly bubble tea shop. He smiled politely but soon froze, staring at the maze of rules. Watching him struggle, I realized it wasn’t only the game that confused him. It was the unspoken rules that often govern everyday talk.</p>
            <p>Many individuals with autism can understand words by their literal meaning but find it hard to read tones, ironics, or implications. That gap between what is said and what is meant fascinated me. I wanted to bridge it, not through therapy, but through language itself. So I taught myself Flutter, an app development framework, and built Voice Intent, an app powered by GPT-4’s API. Users can type or record puzzling sentences, and the app explains whether they are sarcastic, figurative, or sincere.</p>
            <p>When Voice Intent was released on the App Store and Google Play, it became more than a tool but a statement that communication should be accessible to everyone. It also taught me that leadership isn’t always about “organizing people” or speaking loudly. Sometimes it begins with noticing a silent problem and daring to fix it.</p>
