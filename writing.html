        <h2 class="section-title">Phonological Variation and Gender Performance: A Sociolinguistic Study of the “<span class="gloss" data-tooltip="女国音">Nü Guoyin</span>” Phenomenon in Beijing Youth Speech</h2>
        <div class="paper-content">
          <div class="abstract">
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <div class="abstract-body">
              <p>The phenomenon known as <span class="gloss" data-tooltip="女国音">Nǚ Guóyīn</span> (“female national pronunciation”) refers to the fronting of palatal initials [tɕ], [tɕʰ], and [ɕ] to alveolar [ts], [tsʰ], and [s]. Historically documented in Beijing since the 1920s, it was strongly associated with educated young women and explained through aesthetic, dialectal, or intimacy-based accounts. Yet little research has examined its contemporary status under changing gender norms and digital media environments.</p>
              <p>This study investigates <span class="gloss" data-tooltip="女国音">Nǚ Guóyīn</span> among 44 Beijing middle and high school students using speech samples, surveys, and interviews. Results show that 40.9% of participants employed fronted variants, including 26.1% of male speakers, a sharp contrast with earlier findings of exclusively female use. Most users were unaware of their pronunciations, underscoring its unconscious character.</p>
              <p>While statistical differences were modest, fronting users favored lifestyle-oriented platforms such as Xiaohongshu and Weibo, while standard users clustered around gaming and subcultural spaces like Bilibili and Douyin. Interviews highlighted imitation, parody, and performative identity, indicating that the variant now functions as a mediatized style rather than a residual dialect feature.</p>
              <p>The findings reveal that <span class="gloss" data-tooltip="女国音">Nǚ Guóyīn</span> persists but with shifting indexicalities, serving as a resource for both genders in youth identity performance and raising new questions about an emergent “male national pronunciation.”</p>

        <div class="paper-content">
          <div class="abstract ligui-grid">
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <div class="abstract-body">
              <p>The paper focuses on the inscription of the Western Zhou bronze vessel <span class="gloss" data-tooltip="利簋">Li Gui</span>, unearthed in 1976 from Lintong, Shaanxi, to explore its evidentiary value and academic controversies in the context of the Summer, Shang, and Zhou Chronology Project. The phrase “<span class="gloss" data-tooltip="唯甲子朝岁鼎">wei jiazi zhao, sui ding</span>” has long been regarded as a key clue for determining the date of King Wu's conquest of the Shang, serving as a critical piece of evidence for the establishment of 1046 BCE as the historical marker in the Chronology Project.</p>
              <p>From a philological perspective, this paper systematically examines the terminology in the <span class="gloss" data-tooltip="利簋">Li Gui</span> inscription, integrating astronomical observations and archaeological evidence, to analyze its role and limitations in chronological studies. Additionally, it introduces the Western concept of hermeneutic genealogy, establishing an interpretive stemma to enhance transparency and interpretive power in ancient history research.</p>
              <p>By delving into the hierarchical authority of texts, astronomical dating, and semantic punctuation, this paper highlights structural issues in current chronological research concerning methodology and the use of evidence. It calls for a reconstruction of a more inclusive and multi-perspective interpretive framework on an interdisciplinary basis.</p>
              <p>The study demonstrates that the <span class="gloss" data-tooltip="利簋">Li Gui</span> inscription is not only a crucial material for historical chronology but also reflects the complex interaction between linguistic evolution, cultural identity, and institutional memory.</p>
              <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> <span class="gloss" data-tooltip="利簋">Li Gui</span> Inscription; King Wu’s conquest of Shang; sui ding ke wen; textual criticism; hermeneutic genealogy;</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Personal Statement</h2>
        <div class="statement-content">
          <div class="statement-text">
            <img src="assets/trike.png" alt="Trike" class="statement-image" />
            <p>The brown plastic Triceratops in my hand was scratched and faded. His name was Trike, and I’d found him in a plastic box under a utility pole in the small park behind my school—a hiding spot known only to us geocachers. I typed Trike’s code from his metal tag into my phone, and a story unfolded on the screen: he was a birthday gift for a two-year-old boy in Cyprus back in 2009.</p>

            <p>As he rested in my palm, I thought of the oceans he had crossed, the hands he’d passed through—much smaller than mine—and the sixteen years it had taken him to reach me. His original owner would be close to my age now. Stroking the worn surface, I felt a strange stirring in my chest—an invisible thread forming, linking our two lives across distance and time.</p>

            <p>This is the allure of Geocaching: each cache is a vessel for dialogue, whispered across years and continents.</p>

            <p>I first sensed this mysterious connection when I was six, in my mother’s hometown of Urumqi. At a kebab shop outside Hongshan Park, I stood entranced before a Uyghur noticeboard. The curling, unfamiliar characters beckoned like incantations from another world. On a napkin, I copied them one by one, trying to capture their call. Of course, I failed—not only because the script was unknown to me, but because I had unknowingly written every character backwards. Yet even in failure, I discovered something more lasting: the irresistible urge to reach across the gap of language.</p>

            <p>That urge grew into invention: in third grade, I created my own tongue, Wanzi Language (“Meatball Language” in Chinese). A friend recently sent me a photo of the New Year’s card I’d once given him:</p>

            <p><em><span class="gloss" data-tooltip="Xonī, from Chinese 新年 (New Year); Yoda, probably from Japanese 良だ (Good)">Xonīyoda</span>! <span class="gloss" data-tooltip="from Chinese 祝 (Wish)">Chö</span>-<span class="gloss" data-tooltip="from English you">yo</span> Mathematics <span class="gloss" data-tooltip="from Chinese 越来越好 (better and better)">yoniyot</span>!<br />
            <span class="gloss" data-tooltip="from English this">Thīs</span> <span class="gloss" data-tooltip="from English me">my</span> <span class="gloss" data-tooltip="from Chinese 亲手 (by my own hand)">cingo</span> <span class="gloss" data-tooltip="from coì (make), from Chinese 做 (make)">coìd</span>.<br />
            ¡<span class="gloss" data-tooltip="Unknown Origin">Hoyín’ī</span> <span class="gloss" data-tooltip="from Chinese 喜欢 (like [it])">sihuà</span>!</em></p>

            <img src="assets/wanzi.png" alt="Wanzi Language New Year card" class="statement-image wanzi" />

            <p>Even today, I can still recall Wanzi’s grammar—twenty-seven letters, improvised syllables, rules half-remembered. The card’s message was simple: “Happy New Year! Wishing you progress in math! This is made by my own hands. Hope you like it!”</p>

            <p>But for me, words were never enough. A language deserved a world; thus, the Kingdom of Wanzi was born: seven provinces, a national flag, and even an official exchange rate. I rearranged a piano piece I was learning and declared it the national anthem, and before practice, I played it solemnly as a tribute to my imagined republic. With friends, I compiled a trilingual Chinese-English-Wanzi dictionary for encrypted notes, drew comics of Wanzi’s heroes, and spun tales of endless adventures on our walks home.</p>

            <p>Years later, rereading that card, I realized it was never about the mechanics of grammar but the joy of creation, the laughter of shared secrets, and the desire to give a whole world to my friends. Beneath it all was the same yearning: to connect, to communicate, to build meaning together.</p>

            <p>And that’s what I still do.</p>

            <p>In the linguistics club I founded, the roster lists seventy members, but only a handful are deeply devoted. They’re more than enough. We argue late into the night about vowel harmony in Turkic languages; we cheer when we decipher Tangut idioms; we shared quiet awe when we discovered that the Turkish <em>tek</em> (“single”) shares its root with the Chinese character <span class="gloss" data-tooltip="只/隻">zhī</span>. In these moments, we revel in distant civilizations speaking again, like long-buried fossils of human thought uncovered.</p>
