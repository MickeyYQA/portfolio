            <p>Every Friday night, after a week of classes, I’d open my sketchbook and draw. This habit began in my fourth grade, in 2017, after I came across <em>Have you seen my puppy?</em> by my favorite Japanese artist Naoko Takagi. In her book, she writes about her childhood dog, Muku, and how her habit of keeping comic diaries eventually shaped her career. I remember thinking, that’s so amazing — one day, I want to be someone’s Naoko Takagi, inspiring others like she inspires me. Since then, drawing has become a quiet ritual and a way of pausing the world for a moment.</p>

            <p>Some weeks, I sketch daily conversations with friends; some other times, I record my teacher Alan’s farewell in English Literature class or a silly mistake that still makes me smile. Each page distills my past week of life into a single moment I can hold onto.</p>

            <p>Later, when I scroll through my WeChat blog where I post all my comic diary, I often find myself wondering what I was doing exactly a year ago. A casual remark from a friend months ago that I barely noticed and jotted down on the paper might suddenly make a new layer of meaning. Those rediscoveries brings me a rare kind of joy: the sense that time doesn’t just pass, but accumulates meanings as it went.</p>

            <p>Sometimes, my comics and posts branch beyond my daily life. Once, after spending all day fighting with a Python library called KenLM, I wrote a complete guide explaining why it failed on newer Python versions. About a month later, a stranger emailed me saying that my post “saved” them hours of frustration, and even reprinted on their blog. I still remember grinning at the screen and amazed that something written in my room could ripple outward and truly help someone I’d never met.</p>

            <p>Through these drawings and words, I find three quiet joys: in creating, in rediscovering, and in connecting. Each one of them reminds me that even the smallest story could reach beyond its frames.</p>
